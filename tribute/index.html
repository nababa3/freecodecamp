            <ul>
                <li><strong>1967</strong> - He began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sceinces Research Center.</li>
                <li><strong>1972</strong> - He was defended his PhD thesis on "Programm Structure and Computational
                    Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, never officially
                    received his PhD degree.</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - He was a key developer of the Unix operating system, with Ken Thompson.</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - Thompson and himself received the Turing Award for their development of
                    generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating
                    system. His Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".</li>
                <li><strong>1990</strong> - Thompson and himself received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the
                    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating
                    system and the C programming language".</li>
                <li><strong>1997</strong> - Thompson and himself were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for
                    co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language".</li>
                <li><strong>1999</strong> - Thompson and himself jointly received the National Medal of Technology of
                    1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming
                    language which, according to the citation for the medal "led to enormous advances in computer
                    hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby
                    enhancing American leadership in the information Age".</li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - The Industrial Research institute Awarded in recognition of his contribution
                    to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system</li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong> - He, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan prize for information and
                    Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.</li>
                <li><strong>October 12, 2011</strong> - He was found dead at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley
                    Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone. His death came a week after the death of Steve Jobs but
                    did not receive as much media coverage.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>"Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household nam,e at all, but... if you had a
                    microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside."</p>
